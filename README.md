FIRST Robotics Competition Java Code for the 2014 Game: Aerial Assist
This entire repository is a Netbeans FRC Project. The /src/ folder contains
the source code for the Discobots robot, Octanis. The /docs/ folder contains
supplemental documentation that may be useful in understanding the code,
dashboard, game controller, or any physical system on the robot. The
DallasRegionalBackup.zip file is a zipped "tag"/backup of the code at the Dallas
Regional. All future "tags"/backups are to be done with the branch/tag system in
git and not with zip files.
